#Splunk Code to search and display basic pie chart with used and remaining space shown

### search indexes

#For C: Drive: 
host=FSBSPLUNK2 Name="C:" | head 1 | chart eval(sum(TotalSpaceKB) / 1048576) as Total_Space eval(sum(FreeSpaceKB) / 1048576) 
as Free_Space | eval Used_Space = Total_Space - Free_Space | fields Free_Space Used_Space | transpose

#For V: Partition: 
host=FSBSPLUNK2 Name="V:" | head 1 | chart eval(sum(TotalSpaceKB) / 1048576) as Total_Space eval(sum(FreeSpaceKB) / 1048576) 
as Free_Space | eval Used_Space = Total_Space - Free_Space | fields Free_Space Used_Space | transpose

#Show Both Partitions Together and full space stats:
host=FSBSPLUNK2 FileSystem="NTFS" | head 2 | stats sum(eval(TotalSpaceKB/1048576)) as TotalSpace sum(eval(FreeSpaceKB/1048576)) 
as FreeSpace sum(eval((TotalSpaceKB-FreeSpaceKB)/1048576)) as UsedSpace by Name

-- Once saved as an alert, a menu will appear with additional alert options.
-- Set "Trigger Alert When" to custom and in the text box enter "search FreeSpaceKB < 10485760"
-- Make sure to include search or you will get an error.
-- The number at the end is 10 GBs represented as KBs, this can be adjusted.
-- At the bottom there is also an add actions drop down where an email action can be added
-- just enter the email to receive the alert, select other information to be sent with the email, then save

##CLI commands for configuring splunk free 

##change the current directory to the Splunk bin directory so scripts from the bin can be run
cd <splunk_folder_in_program_files>\bin\

.\splunk <----- must be before each splunk command

.\splunk add forward-server <host>:<port>

##CLI for Splunk UF

##same reason as before, to run splunk scripts
cd <splunk_universal_forwarder_in_program_files>\bin

##command to list forwarders for splunk UF
.\splunk list forward-server

##run the restart command so the splunk can apply the configurations
##this should also be done after changing any .conf files
.\splunk restart
